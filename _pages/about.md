About
======
I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I completed my Ph.D. at City University of Hong Kong, advised by [Prof. Qing Li](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csqli/). Before that, I received a B.Eng. in Information Security from Nankai University in 2011 and a M.Phil. in Computer Science from City University of Hong Kong in 2014. My research interests are in the areas of computer vision and deep learning. Recently I'm interested in generative adversarial networks and domain adaptation.
