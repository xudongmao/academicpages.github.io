About
======
I am a first year Ph.D. student at [City University of Hong Kong](http://www.cityu.edu.hk/), advised by [Prof. Qing Li](http://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~csqli/). My research interests are in the areas of computer vision and deep learning. Recently I'm interested in generative adversarial networks and unsupervised learning.

Before starting my Ph.D. study, I received a B.Eng. in Information Security from Nankai University in 2011 and a M.Phil. in Computer Science from City University of Hong Kong in 2014. During 2014-2016, I worked as a senior algorithm engineer at institute of data science and technology of Alibaba.
